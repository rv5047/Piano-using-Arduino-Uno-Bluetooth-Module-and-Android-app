# Piano-using-Arduino-Uno-Bluetooth-Module-and-Android-app

This project was created by making the modifications to an existing project. The existing project was modified by using a Bluetooth module to transmit input to Arduino Uno instead of Push buttons, Keypad, or Paper piano. Arduino Uno, Piezo speaker, Bluetooth module, and Android app were used to complete this project. The Bluetooth module is only used as a slave in this project as it only receives the data from the android app. The Designed piano was able to play 7 notes (’A”, ’B’, ’C’, ’D’, ’E’, ’F’, and ’G’).
